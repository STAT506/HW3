### Q1. Based on GH  CH.2 Ex 3 (8 points)

Demonstration of the Central Limit Theorem: let $x = x_1 + ... + x_20,$ the sum of 20 independent Uniform(0,1) random variables. In R, create 1000 simulations of $x$ and plot their histogram. On the histogram, overlay a graph of the normal density function. Comment on any differences between the histogram and the curve.

_Then repeat the exercise for 10, 50, and 100 independent Uniform random variables_


### Q2. Based on GH  CH.2 Ex 4 (6 points)

Distribution of averages and differences: the heights of men in the United States are approximately normally distributed with mean 69.1 inches and standard deviation 2.9 inches. The heights of women are approximately normally distributed with mean 63.7 inches and standard deviation of 2.7 inches. Let x be the average height of 100 randomly sampled men, and y be the average height of 100 randomly sampled women. In R, create 1000 simulations of $x-y$ and plot their histogram. Using simulations, compute the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of $x-y$. Then compare the simulated results for $x-y$ to  their exact (analytical) values. Note: if $z_1 \sim N(\mu_1, \sigma^2_1)$ and $z_2 \sim N(\mu_2, \sigma^2_2)$ are independent normal random variables, then $z_1 - z_2 \sim N(\mu_1 - \mu_2, \sigma^2_1 + \sigma^2_2)$
